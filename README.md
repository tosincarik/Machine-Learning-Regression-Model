# Regression-Model
Regression Model Project Using Multiple Regression and Polynomial Regression

This Project demonstrates the use of Linear Regression and Polynomial Regression model in making predictions about the chance of student admission into university based on multiple factors

# Introduction
The journey towards university admission is a significant milestone for countless aspiring students, where the dream of securing a place in their desired institution hinges on a multitude of factors. In this narrative, we embark on a data-driven exploration, leveraging regression modelling techniques to unravel the complexities of admission predictions and identify the most effective approach.
Unveiling the Variables
Our exploration begins with an ensemble of independent variables, each representing a pivotal aspect of a student's profile:
GRE Score: A standardized test measuring aptitude for graduate-level academic study.
University Rating: A qualitative assessment of the reputation and quality of the applicant's chosen institution.
SOP (Statement of Purpose): A personal statement detailing the applicant's academic and career aspirations.
TOEFL Score: A measure of English language proficiency for non-native speakers.
LOR (Letter of Recommendation): Endorsements from academic or professional mentors attesting to the applicant's character and capabilities.
CGPA: The Cumulative Grade Point Average, reflecting academic performance across courses.
Research Experience: Participation in scholarly or scientific research endeavours.

Central to our investigation is the dependent variable, the "Chance of Admit," serving as the ultimate indicator of an applicant's likelihood of securing admission.

# Data Exploration and Model Selection
Armed with a dataset encompassing these variables, we embark on a journey of exploration. Leveraging Python's data science ecosystem and scikit learn library, we pre-process and analyse the data, ensuring its integrity and readiness for modelling.
Data Pre-processing
Dataset was imported from Kaggle using Kaggle API json file.

# Model Selection
## Linear Regression
Our journey commences with the deployment of a Multiple Linear Regression model. This foundational approach offers insights into the linear relationships between independent and dependent variables. Upon model training and evaluation, we attain an initial accuracy of 65%, providing a baseline for comparison.


# Polynomial Linear Regression
## Seeking Refinement: Polynomial Regression
Driven by a pursuit of enhanced accuracy, we embrace Polynomial Regression as a refined approach.
Deploying a Polynomial Regression model with a degree of 2, we witness a remarkable transformation. Our predictive accuracy skyrockets to 90%, a testament to the model's capacity to capture the intricacies and nuances embedded within the dataset.

# A Conclusion ofÂ Promise
Our journey through regression modelling underscores the dynamic nature of predictive analytics in the realm of university admissions. From the foundational principles of Multiple Linear Regression to the refined capabilities of Polynomial Regression, we've witnessed the power of data-driven insights in illuminating the path towards informed decision-making.
As we reflect on our journey, we affirm the imperative of selecting the most suitable modelling approach tailored to the nuances of the dataset at hand. In our quest for precision and accuracy, we find assurance in the promise of regression modelling as a beacon guiding aspiring students towards their academic aspirations.
